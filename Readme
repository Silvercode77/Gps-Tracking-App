This a Gps Tracking Web App where a Gps device is hooked to an esp32 and sends Gps data over mqtt to web server, to essentially track a moving bus

the server then takes the data and shows the gps coordinates in real time

the server also allows the developpers to add station's coordinates in the database which it can use to calculate the shortest path a bus can take to reach it

Ps: note that the route calculation algorithm/engine isn't included in this repo since it is enormous in size but the calcRoute.js is almost a universal API
that works with most other APIS , Precisely in this project OSRM was used by hosting it in a Docker containement


Now for the esp side the arduino framework was used but an esp idf one is being developped currently

TinyGpsplus was used to parse data from the Gps device
and Pubsubclient was used to send data over mqtt
